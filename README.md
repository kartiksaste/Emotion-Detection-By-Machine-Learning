# Emotion Detection Using Deep Learning

This project implements a real-time emotion detection system using a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model. The system processes live video input from a webcam, detects faces, and classifies the detected facial expressions into seven emotion categories: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise.

## Features
- Real-time face detection using OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier.
- Emotion classification using a pre-trained `.h5` model.
- Displays detected emotions on the live webcam feed.



## Installation
